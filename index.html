            <p class="text-decation">Web developers may work on the front-end, which is the part of the website that the
                user interacts with,
                or on the back-end, which is the behind-the-scenes functionality of the website. They may also work on
                the full-stack, which involves both the front-end and back-end of a website.Web development is the
                process of building, creating, and maintaining websites. Web developers use a variety of programming
                languages and technologies to bring websites to life. These can include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby
                on Rails, and more.
